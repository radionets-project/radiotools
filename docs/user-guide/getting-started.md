## Install `radiotools`

``radiotools`` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/radionets-radiotools/)
To install ``radiotools`` into an existing virtual environment, use
one of the following installation methods.


::::{admonition} Should I use `pip` or ...?
:class: hint dropdown

With many so many package installers available, installing software can be
confusing. Here is a guide to help you make a sensible choice.

1. **Are you already using an environment manager?**

   Great, then you should use that tool to install `radiotools`.

2. **Are you considering using an environment manager?**

   There are lots of environment managers to choose from.
   If you are unsure where to start, consider starting with
   [a Python virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).
   [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is also a great choice
   and comes in a lightweight bundle with [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

3. **If environment managers are not your thing...**

   ...you can also use `pip` to install packages directly to your Python path using

   ```console

      $ pip install -U radiotools

   ```

:class: warning
:name: warning:env-management

While environment managers may sound complicated at first, they are strongly recommended.
Ignoring them may lead to confusion if something breaks later on.
